yog is WIP to get code folding to work, scite has bad docs and no example.
currently yog works it code folds until you start adding lines, I have tried everything
right now it clears out the bit mask for folding when the styler is started which is after each key press
it seems scite knows or skipps anything not directly typed in so then the matchs are ignored since they are already styled
I GUESS

efpsescript works, great.lua is the lexer, multi word keywords are styled that's great, no weirdness

of course you need to install scite, and then find it's home files in \programdata\scite and place the lexer in the lexers dir, and the properies with the rest of them

and of course scite people liek don't exist at all.
